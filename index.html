        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>A three member band that plays like five, Sir Sly shuns pop iconography with a firm refusal to conform. Their most mainstream hit, <i>High</i>, doesn't advocate for cannabis as much as it simply tells the truth about the experience of using it. As the nation toys with universal decriminalization of the flower, Sir Sly challenges the Refer Madness alarmism of other substances, most notably LSD in their hit song <i>Astronaut.</i></p>
        <p>
        The trio share a similar physical stature appearing as a trio of Gumbys but much less menacing. Thier music style includes a mix of pop and electronica with solid rock roots. They incorpoated a wide range of vocals including some impressive falsettos. This along with their wiry frames give them both the appearance and style reminiscent of Blind Melon.
